This is a Node app only for leaning  purposes 
Authentication : with the inclusion of authentication we came from any user being able to delete and edit any post to make  this only possible for the owner of the post 
By checking those conditions with the inclusion of the middleware 

Edit and delete comments 

Getting the update and delete routes to work and adding the authorization to work 

This ends the CRUD   now you can create  read update and delete and there is permissions in there authorization and authentication

to be continue....
